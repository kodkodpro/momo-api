## Architecture

Rails 8.1 API-only app (Ruby 4.0.1, PostgreSQL) that serves as a reverse proxy for the OpenAI API, built for the Fren iOS app. Future scope: authorization, caching, rate limiting, subscription verification, dynamic app config.

### Key routes

- `match "proxy/openai/*path"` — reverse-proxies to OpenAI API with injected auth headers
- `get "up"` — health check
- `root` — home

### Key libraries

- **rails-reverse-proxy** — proxies requests in `ProxyController`
- **sorbet** (`typed: true` minimum) — static + runtime type checking
- **sorbet-schema** — typed structs (used for `EnvConfig` in `lib/env.rb`)
- **memery** — memoization (included in `ApplicationController`)
- **operandi** — service object pattern (github: akodkod/operandi)
- **rubocop-sane** — custom RuboCop rules (github: akodkod/rubocop-sane)
- **spy** — test spies/mocks; custom assertions in `test/support/spy.rb`

### Views & components

This app uses **Phlex** (`phlex-rails`, `phlex-sorbet`) for views/components and
**RubyUI** (`ruby_ui`) as the design system. Detailed conventions and examples
live in [`.claude/rules/phlex-rubyui.md`](.claude/rules/phlex-rubyui.md) — read
that file before writing or editing anything under `app/views/` or
`app/components/`.

Key rules at a glance:

- Pages inherit `Views::Base`; app components inherit `Components::Base`;
  design-system primitives inherit `RubyUI::Base`.
- Every component takes inputs via a nested `class Props < T::Struct` and
  `include Phlex::Sorbet`.
- Render RubyUI components as PascalCase method calls (`Heading`, `Text`,
  `Card`, …) — they're auto-included via `Components::Base`.
- **Prefer installing a RubyUI component over hand-writing one.** Use the CLI:
  ```bash
  bin/rails generate ruby_ui:component:all --pretend   # list all components
  bin/rails generate ruby_ui:component <Name>          # install one
  ```
  Generated files land in `app/components/ruby_ui/<name>/` and are yours to edit.

### Environment config

Typed env vars live in `lib/env.rb` as a `T::Struct` called `EnvConfig`. Access via the `Env` constant (e.g., `Env.openai_api_key`). Add new env vars there as typed properties.

## Testing

Support files in `test/support/` are auto-loaded. Custom assertions available:

- `assert_spy_called(spy)` — asserts the spy was called at least once
- `assert_spy_not_called(spy)` — asserts the spy was never called

## Code style

### File headers

Every `.rb` file starts with two lines:

```ruby
# typed: true
# frozen_string_literal: true
```

Use `# typed: strict` for initializers and config files.

### Conventions

- **Double quotes** for all strings
- **Trailing commas** in multiline arrays/hashes (`consistent_comma`); `diff_comma` for method args
- **Compact class style** — `class Fren::Application < Rails::Application` not nested modules
- **Lambda literal** — `->` not `lambda`
- **Hash shorthand** — `{ key: }` when variable matches symbol name
- **No line length limit**, no method/class/block length limits

### Multiline formatting

First argument/parameter on its own line when breaking across lines. `AllowMultilineFinalElement: true`.
